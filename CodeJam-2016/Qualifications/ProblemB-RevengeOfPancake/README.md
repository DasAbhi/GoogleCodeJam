#Pancakes.cpp

This Repistory holds my solution to the 2016's qualification round's second question. The problem was slved in C++. Pancakes.cpp holds the main solution, while test.cpp was used to test out segments of the code, to make sure it was functional, and for further investigations into possible bugs. Both files were compiled into their respective .exe files. The .txt files were used to test the Code's minimum functionality, while the .in files provided by google were used to see if the algorithm truely worked as intended.
