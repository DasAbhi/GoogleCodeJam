#Counting Sheep

This repository contains all the main files used to solve the Sheep counting problem, provided by GoogleCodeJam in 2016.
All source code is written in C++, sheep.cpp contains my solution to the problem. While test.cpp was used to test out functionality of segements of my code from sheep.cpp. input.txt and output.txt were used to test the bare minimum functionality of my code, while the .in files were used to truely tell if my code solved the problem or not.
